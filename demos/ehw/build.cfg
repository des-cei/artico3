# ARTICo3 hardware accelerator settings
#
#   HwSource - type of source code that should be used to generate
#              the ARTICo3 accelerators
#                vhdl
#                verilog
#                hls
#
#   MemBytes - local memory storage size in Bytes (might be slightly
#              increased to deal with bank partitioning, so that each
#              memory bank contains an integer number of 32-bit words)
#                1 - 65536 (TODO: increase the limit by adapting ARTICo3 address bus)
#              NOTE: this value is ORIENTATIVE, since the toolchain modifies it
#                    to get the closest (ceiling) value that renders a
#                    partitioning in which all banks (see next parameter)
#                    have an integer amount of 32-bit words (ARTICo3 data
#                    bus width). Therefore, and since there is a 64kB
#                    limitation (hardware addressing), users should not
#                    push the limit (use only the amount of memory required).
#
#   MemBanks - number of memory banks to be generated (each one provides
#              only one R/W access port from/to the user logic)
#              NOTE: in HLS-based cores, this equals the amount of I/O
#                    ports specified in the code
#
#   Regs     - number of Read/Write registers available in the kernel
#
#   RstPol   - reset polarity of user logic (not required for HLS-based kernels)
#                high
#                low  (default)
